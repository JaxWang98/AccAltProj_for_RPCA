# AccAltProj for RPCA
This is the Matlab code repo for a fast provable non-convex Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) algorithm introduced in [1], which has theoretical global linear convergence guarantee and high robustness in practice. 

## Robust Principal Component Analysis
In this project, we focus on RPCA problem under fully observed setting, that is about separating a low rank matrix $L$ and a sparse outlier matrix $S$ from their sum $D = L + S$.

## Key Idea for Acceleration
Alternating projections is a minimization approach that has been successfully used in many fields. Naturally, for RPCA, we want to project between the sets $\mathcal{M} := \{ (L,S) | L\text{ is low rank} \}$ and $\mathcal{S} := {(L,S) | S\text{ is sparse and } L + S =D}$ for convergence, an earlier example of such approach is [2].

In our algorithm, we used a manifold tangent space projection $\mathcal{P}_T$ along with a very small singular value decomposition (SVD) to accelerate the projection onto the manifold $\mathcal{M}$. Our method of L updating is a lot faster than using the full size truncated SVD, and is tied with the other state-of-the-art RPCA algorithms in terms of complexity, such as gradient decent based L updating in [3].

When update S, we employ hard thresholding operator with selected threshold values per iteration. In terms of speed, ours are tied with [1], being the fastest S updating method so far. Additionally, the selected threshold values are proved for supplying the desired sparsity for S aat each iterition under some nature conditions. 

Together with the speed of L updating, S updating, and guaranteed global linear convergence, we proudly introduce this fast provable non-convex algorithm for fully observed RPCA, namely AccAltProj.
